Within this basic application, users can select from two different modes at the home screen: The Purchase mode and the Sell mode.

From the purchase mode, users can view a list of items with their respected costs and add these items into a shopping cart by clicking the plus icons next to each item.
As items are added, the shopping cart icon (at the top right side of the screen) will reflect the number of items selected, and by clicking on this shopping cart icon, the user will be taken to a checkout page.
Within this checkout page, the items selected prior will be listed along side their price. At the bottom right of the page, the prices of all items will be provided as a sum, indicating how much the total will cost should you purchase the listed items together (no purchase functionality has been added).

From the sell mode, users are able to add their own custom items to be sold on the website by inputting a name and the cost of the item. Once this data is entered, pressing the "Put Item For Sale" button will generate the item within the list presented on the purchase page. Items added in this way are completely functional and can be added to the shopping cart just like any other item.
